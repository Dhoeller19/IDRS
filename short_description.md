In case of a severe disaster (hurricane, earthquake) we provide a system to automatically collect large-scale data about medical emergencies for hospitals in order to assist them with coordinating the emergency dispatch. On the patient side, we provide a web-app with intelligent chatbot for instant assessment and classification of injuries. On the hospital side, the data of all emergencies is aggregated and visualized in real time on a city map in order to identify high-priority regions for ambulance dispatch.
